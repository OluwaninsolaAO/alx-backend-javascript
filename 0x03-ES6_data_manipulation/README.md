# 0x03. ES6 data manipulation

In the realm of JavaScript, where loops abound, a palindrome of
knowledge can be found. 'FOROF' it whispers for iterables so fine, a
melody of looping that stands the test of time. Arrays and Sets, with
elegance, it prevails, traversing each element, as their stories unveil
But when objects arise, 'FORIN' takes the stage, dancing through
properties, turning each page. Remember this symphony, harmonious and
grand, FOROF, a palindrome, a loop to understand.
