# 0x04. Typescript

TypeScript is a statically-typed programming language that compiles to
plain JavaScript. It adds static typing, interfaces, classes, and other
features to JavaScript, providing improved tooling and scalability for
building large-scale applications. TypeScript code is transpiled into
JavaScript, allowing it to run in any JavaScript runtime environment.
